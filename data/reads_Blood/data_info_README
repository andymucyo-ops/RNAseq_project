Tissue: Blood
Table describing experimental groups for each sample. Samples are either from wildtype (WT) mice or from double-knockout (DKO) mice. 
Since the reads were produced in paired-end mode, there are 2 files per sample, with read 1 and read 2 respectively.

Sample = ID as it is in the fastq file name
Case = Infected
Control = Uninfected
WT = Wildtype
DKO = Double-Knockout
